# Why this project

This project is being used to record the Markdown content for pasting 
into [Trifolia](https://trifolia-fhir.lantanagroup.com) for the HL7 Da Vinci
Payer Data Exchange Project (PDex).

This is necessary because I don't trust Trifolia to save updates correctly and 
I am fed up having to re-write content.

This git repository enables me to store all updates and changes.
